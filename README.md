# ClassifyProducts_Project
The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to classify products into the correct category. There are nine categories for all products. Each target category represents one of the most important product categories (like fashion, electronics, etc.).


 
The Otto Group is one of the worldâ€™s biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France). They are selling millions of products worldwide every day, with always new products being added to the product line. A consistent analysis of the performance of the products is crucial. However, due to the diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently. Therefore, the quality of the product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products. The better the classification, the more insights Otto can generate about the product range.
